# DISCLAIMER 
This project is part of the final examn for the training/education to become a "data technician with a specialty in infrastructure".
The project is to be used "as is", and the author does not provide any support at all. This project has primarily been handled and worked on in a custom environment that has, since then, been shut down and deleted for good.
